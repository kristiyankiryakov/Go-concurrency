/*
Task 2: Log Processing with Worker Pool
ðŸ’¡ Scenario: You have a stream of log messages that need to be processed efficiently using multiple workers.

Hints (Less Guidance Now):
Read log lines from a slice (simulate a continuous log stream).
Create a channel to send log messages to workers.
Start N workers that process logs concurrently.
Each worker should print the log message with its worker ID.
Ensure all workers finish before exiting (sync.WaitGroup).
ðŸ”¹ Bonus Challenge:
Instead of a fixed number of logs, use an infinite loop to continuously generate logs.
Use a quit channel to stop processing gracefully.
