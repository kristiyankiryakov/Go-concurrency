/*
Task 1: Simulating a Ticket Booking System ðŸ’¡
 Scenario: You are building a concert ticket booking system where multiple users try to book tickets at the same time.

Guidance:
Start with a total number of available tickets (e.g., 10).
Create multiple Goroutines representing users trying to book a ticket.
Use a channel to handle booking requests.
Process bookings safely by making sure two users donâ€™t book the same ticket.
Print confirmation messages for successful bookings and rejections if tickets run out.
ðŸ”¹ Bonus Challenge:

Use a sync.Mutex or sync/atomic package to ensure ticket count is updated safely.
Add a waiting list feature using a second channel for unfulfilled requests
